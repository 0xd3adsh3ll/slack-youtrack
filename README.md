slack-youtrack
==============

Integration of slack and you track.

Main functionality here is change management:

* show ticket changes
* linkify references to issues
* map the changes to the appropriate channel

Of course, to do this we have an agent being woken up regularly that:

1. goes to the RSS feed
1. for each item found there, calls into the REST interface to get changes
1. formats the change info
1. posts it to the channel

That's it.
